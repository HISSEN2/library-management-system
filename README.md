MY LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYTEM
Add Book: This button allows the librarian or admin to add a new book to the library database. When clicked, it should prompt the user to enter details such as title, author, genre, publication year, etc., and then add this information to the library's database.
Search Book: This button enables users to search for books in the library's database based on various criteria such as title, author, genre, etc. When clicked, it should prompt the user to enter search keywords and then display a list of matching books, if any.
Issue Book: This button allows users to issue a book from the library. When clicked, it should prompt the user to enter the book's details or select from a list of available books, and then update the database to mark the book as issued to the user.
Book Holder: This button displays information about the current holder of a specific book. When clicked, it should prompt the user to enter the book's details or select from a list of books, and then display the name of the person who currently has the book issued.
Return Book: This button allows users to return a book to the library. When clicked, it should prompt the user to enter the book's details or select from a list of books issued to them, and then update the database to mark the book as returned.
Clear Screen: This button clears the display screen to provide a clean interface. It's a simple feature but can enhance the user experience by removing clutter.
All Books: This button displays a list of all books available in the library's database. When clicked, it should fetch and display all the books stored in the database.
Exit: This button exits the library management system application, closing the program gracefully.
To implement these functionalities, you'll likely need to use libraries like Tkinter for the GUI (Graphical User Interface), and possibly SQLite or another database system to manage the library's data. Each button would be associated with a specific function or method that performs the corresponding action when clicked.
